Based on the provided context, here is a step-by-step guide for working with files in HDFS on Windows: 1. Start Hadoop services. 2. Verify HDFS is running by checking the connection with the command: `hdfs dfs -ls /` 3. Upload files using: `hdfs dfs -put localfile.txt /user/hadoop/` 4. List files using: `hdfs dfs -ls /user/hadoop/` 5. Download files using: `hdfs dfs -get /user/hadoop/file.txt C:/path/to/local/` 6. Delete files using: `hdfs dfs -rm /user/hadoop/file.txt` If you encounter a "Connection refused" error, ensure that Hadoop services are running and there are no port conflicts. You can start Hadoop services by following the steps in Step 1 of the provided context. If you have any further questions or need more specific assistance, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help.
